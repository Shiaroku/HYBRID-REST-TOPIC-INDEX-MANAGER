# HYBRID-REST-TOPIC-INDEX-MANAGER
Enriching OpenDistro Text Documents Indexing through custom REST-Generated Embeddings

# Create .env file
You can follow the .env.example file

# Download Gutenberg Dataset in ~/Gutenberg/txt/
Replace 'Lorem Ipsum.txt' with text files.
If you have no text documents to run test on, I recommend using files from the Gutenberg Dataset available here : https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~lahiri/gutenberg_dataset.html

# How to use it ?

You should have a running instance of OpenDistro. Here we kept default configuration. localhost:9200 and {admin,admin} authentification  
You should also have a running instance of the [HYBRID-REST-TOPIC](https://github.com/UBitSandBox/HYBRID-REST-TOPIC) API. Here we also kept default config so localhost:8000  
Then run in terminal :   
- ```python3 indexing.py``` for indexing  
- ```python3 querying.py``` for querying
